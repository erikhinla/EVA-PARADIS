**February Invoice — $1,250**

This month is a reduced rate. Instead of the usual $2,500, I'm only charging $1,250 to cover hard costs and my labor.

Hard Costs ($725):
• AI Compute (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok) — $300
• Agent Team (Manus IM) — $125
• Advanced Models (Claude 4.6, GPT 5.3) — $125
• Hosting (VPS, Vercel, Railway) — $70
• Dev Environment (Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurfer) — $65
• Database (Supabase Pro) — $25
• Design Licensing — $15

Labor ($525):
• Analytics setup (GA4, Meta Pixel, event tracking) — $150
• Bug fixes (dashboard schema, data pipeline) — $100
• Marketing cadence plan + content strategy — $125
• Platform maintenance & monitoring — $150

**Total Due: $1,250**

This month only — next month returns to the standard $2,500 as we ramp up marketing and paid campaigns.

Let me know if you have any questions. 🖤
