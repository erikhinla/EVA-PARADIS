### Spam Report Risk

## Compliance Notes

1. **Never mention OnlyFans directly on Instagram** - use "exclusive content" or "other platform"
2. **All links go through bridge domain** - never direct OF links
3. **Personalization required** - reference specific content when possible
4. **No automated bulk sending** - manual or semi-automated only
5. **Track all conversations** - log in dashboard for analysis
