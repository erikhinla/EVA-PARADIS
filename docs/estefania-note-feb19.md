Hey Eva,

Here's your full update on where things stand, what we fixed, what's new, and the billing for this month.

## What's Live & Working

**Your site (evaparadis.net):**
- ✅ Live and loading fast
- ✅ Social share previews fixed — when you share links on X, Reddit, IG stories, the card shows your image + title instead of blank
- ✅ Instagram redirect fix — IG was blocking direct links, we built a workaround so links work in DMs and stories

**Your smart link (evaparadis.net/go):**
- ✅ Working — redirects with tracking. This is the ONE link you put everywhere: bios, DMs, posts, stories. Everything funnels through here.

**Analytics (just installed today):**
- ✅ Google Analytics (GA4) — now tracking every page view, every OF click, every social link click
- ✅ Meta Pixel — same tracking, plus you can now run retargeting ads to people who visited your site
- ✅ Supabase database — storing all events. We found and fixed bugs where the dashboard wasn't showing real numbers. You have 94 tracked visits and 2 leads captured (including a real one from Instagram today)

**Your links:**
- Main site: **evaparadis.net**
- Smart link (for bios/DMs/posts): **evaparadis.net/go**
- Dashboard (internal): **evaparadis.me/dashboard**

## Marketing Plan — Weekly Posting Cadence

Here's the schedule to start driving consistent traffic:

**Monday:** Reddit (2-3 posts across subreddits) + Redgifs (1 clip)
**Tuesday:** X/Twitter (1 photo post) + TikTok (1 short video)
**Wednesday:** Reddit (2-3 more posts) + IG Stories (2-3 stories with link)
**Thursday:** Redgifs (1 clip) + X/Twitter (1 engagement post)
**Friday:** Reddit (2-3 posts) + IG Reels (1 reel)
**Saturday:** Tube site trailer (1 preview clip with evaparadis.net watermark)
**Sunday:** Rest / batch content for next week

**Weekly totals:** ~15-20 pieces of content across all platforms

**The rule:** Every single link goes to **evaparadis.net/go** — never link OF directly. The smart link tracks everything so we can see exactly which platform and which content drives the most subscriptions.

**We're testing 3 angles to see what converts best:**
1. Mystery/tease (curiosity-driven)
2. Lifestyle/personality (connection-driven)
3. Direct/bold (straightforward)

We'll track which one gets the most clicks and OF conversions in your dashboard.

## February Invoice — $1,250

This month is a reduced rate. Instead of the usual $2,500, I'm only charging **$1,250** to cover hard costs and labor. Here's the breakdown:

### Hard Costs (Infrastructure to keep everything running)

| Item | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| AI Compute (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok) | $300 |
| Agent Team (Manus IM) | $125 |
| Advanced Models (Claude 4.6, GPT 5.3) | $125 |
| Hosting (VPS, Vercel, Railway) | $70 |
| Dev Environment (Cursor, Antigravity, Windsurfer) | $65 |
| Database (Supabase Pro) | $25 |
| Design Licensing | $15 |
| **Hard Costs Subtotal** | **$725** |

### Labor

| Item | Amount |
|------|--------|
| Analytics setup (GA4, Meta Pixel, event tracking) | $150 |
| Bug fixes (dashboard schema, data pipeline) | $100 |
| Marketing cadence plan + content strategy | $125 |
| Platform maintenance & monitoring | $150 |
| **Labor Subtotal** | **$525** |

### Total

| | |
|---|---|
| Hard Costs | $725 |
| Labor | $525 |
| **Total Due** | **$1,250** |

**This month only: $1,250 (not $2,500).** Next month returns to the standard rate as we ramp up the marketing engine and start running paid campaigns.

## What's Next

1. Start posting using the weekly cadence above
2. After 1 week of posts, we review the dashboard together — see which platform/angle is winning
3. Build your ROI story (traffic → clicks → subs) once we have 2 weeks of data
4. Set up retargeting ads using the Meta Pixel data we're now collecting

Let me know if you have any questions. 🖤
