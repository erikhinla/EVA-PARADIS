### Weekly Totals
- **Reddit:** 6-9 posts across 2-3 subreddits
- **Redgifs:** 2 clips
- **X/Twitter:** 2 posts (1 photo, 1 engagement)
- **TikTok:** 1 video
- **IG:** 1 reel + 2-3 stories

## Subreddit Targets (Rotate)
Pick 2-3 per posting day from your niche. Examples:
- r/onlyfanspromotion
- r/OnlyFansPromotions  
- Niche-specific subs matching Eva's content style
- Verification required on most — do this once upfront

**Rule:** Never link OF directly on Reddit. Profile → evaparadis.net/go → OF.

## Test Creatives (First 2 Weeks)

### Angle A: "Mystery / Tease"
- Cropped or partially hidden shots
- Caption: suggestive but not explicit
- CTA: "More at link in bio"
- **Hypothesis:** Curiosity drives higher CTR

### Angle B: "Lifestyle / Personality"
- Behind-the-scenes, day-in-the-life
- Caption: conversational, relatable
- CTA: "Get to know me → link in bio"
- **Hypothesis:** Emotional connection drives longer retention / higher LTV

### Angle C: "Direct / Bold"
- High-quality glamour shots
- Caption: confident, direct
- CTA: "Don't miss out → link in bio"
- **Hypothesis:** Straightforward approach converts fastest

**Track in dashboard:** Which angle drives most clicks on evaparadis.net/go and highest OF conversion.

## DM Strategy (Low Volume, High Intent)
- **Reddit:** Reply to commenters on your posts. Don't mass-DM. Warm leads only.
- **IG:** Reply to story reactions and DM requests. Use the bridge page scripts already built.
- **Pacing:** Max 10-15 DMs/day across all platforms to avoid bans.

## Tracking
All traffic flows through **evaparadis.net/go** with UTM parameters:

## Anti-Ban Rules
1. Never post the same image to multiple subs simultaneously — stagger by 24h minimum
2. Don't use link shorteners on Reddit (auto-flagged)
3. Verify on every subreddit before posting
4. No mass-DM tools — manual only
5. TikTok: keep it SFW, never mention OF by name
6. IG: don't put OF link directly in bio — use evaparadis.net/go
